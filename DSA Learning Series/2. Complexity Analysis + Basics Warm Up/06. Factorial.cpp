    For example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed 
    that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2 then Z(N1)â‰¤Z(N2). It is because we can never "lose" any trailing zero by multiplying by any 
    positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.
