    In a recent breakthrough in mathematics, the proof utilized a concept called Height.
    Consider a fraction a / b. Its Height is defined as the maximum of its numerator and denominator. So, for example, the Height of 3 / 19 would be 19, and the Height
    of 27 / 4 would be 27.
    Given a and b, find the Height of a / b.
    
    Sample 1:
              Input :  3 19
              Output : 19
              Explanation: The maximum of {3,19} is 19. Hence the Height of 3 / 19 is 19.
             
    Sample 2:
              Input :  27 4
              Output : 27
              Explanation: The maximum of {27,4} is 27. Hence the Height of 27 / 4 is 27.
