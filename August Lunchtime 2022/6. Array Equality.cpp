    Chef has an array of N integers. Chef can rearrange this array in any manner.
    Chef doesnâ€™t like the array if any two adjacent elements are equal. Determine whether there exists a rearrangement of the array that Chef likes.
    
    Sample 1:
            Input :
                  2
                  5
                  1 1 1 1 1
                  3
                  3 3 4
            Output :
                  No
                  Yes
            Explanation:
                  Test case 1: There exists no rearrangement of the array which Chef will like.
                  Test case 2: A rearrangement of the array that Chef likes is [3,4,3]. Note that in this rearrangement, no two adjacent elements are equal.
