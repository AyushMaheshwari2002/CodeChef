    You are given an integer N.
    Construct any permutation A of N integers such that the value LCM(1 + A1 ,2 + A2, ..., N + AN) is minimised.
    
    Note:
        LCM denotes the least common multiple of the integers.
        A permutation of N integers contains all integers from 1 to N exactly once.
        
    Sample 1:
            Input :
                  1
                  2
            Output :
                  2 1
            Explanation:
                  Test case 1: The permutation for which the value is minimised is [2,1]. The minimum value is LCM(1+2,2+1) = LCM(3,3) = 3.
