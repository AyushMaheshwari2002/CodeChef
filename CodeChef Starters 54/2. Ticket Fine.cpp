    On a certain train, Chef-the ticket collector, collects a fine of Rs. X if a passenger is travelling without a ticket. It is known that a passenger carries either
    a single ticket or no ticket.
    P passengers are travelling and they have a total of Q tickets. Help Chef calculate the total fine collected.
    
    Sample 1:
         Input :
              4
              4 1 1
              2 10 7
              8 5 4
              9 7 0
        Output :
              0
              6
              8
              63
        Explanation:
              Test case 1: The total number of passengers travelling without ticket are 1 - 1 = 0. So the total fine collected is 0⋅4 = 0 rupees.
              Test case 2: The total number of passengers travelling without ticket are 10 - 7 = 3. So the total fine collected is 3⋅2 = 6 rupees.
              Test case 3: The total number of passengers travelling without ticket are 5 - 4 = 15. So the total fine collected is 1⋅8 = 8 rupees.
              Test case 4: The total number of passengers travelling without ticket are 7 - 0 = 7. So the total fine collected is 7⋅9 = 63 rupees.
