    Chef has 3 numbers P, Q and R. Chef wants to find the number of triples (A, B, C) such that:
           * (A | B) = P, (B | C) = Q and (C | A) = R (Here, | denotes the bitwise OR operation)
           * 0 â‰¤ A,B,C < 20
    Can you help Chef?

    Sample 1:
         Input :
                3
                10 12 14
                0 5 5
                0 0 7
          Output :
                4
                1
                0
          Explanation:
                Test case 1: The following 4 triplets (A, B, C) satisfy A|B = 10, B|C = 12, and C|A = 14 : (2, 8, 12), (10, 0, 12), (10, 8, 4) and (10, 8, 12).
                Test case 2: The following triplet (A, B, C) satisfies A|B = 0, B|C = 5, and C|A = 5 : (0, 0, 5).
                Test case 3: There are no triplets satisfying all the conditions.
