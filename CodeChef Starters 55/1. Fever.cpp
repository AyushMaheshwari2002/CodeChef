    Chef is not feeling well today. He measured his body temperature using a thermometer and it came out to be X °F.
    A person is said to have fever if his body temperature is strictly greater than 98 °F.
    Determine if Chef has fever or not.
    
    Sample 1:
          Input :
                3
                98
                100
                96
          Output :
                NO
                YES
                NO
          Explanation:
                Test Case 1: Since X = 98 is not greater than 98, Chef does not have fever.
                Test Case 2: Since X = 100 is greater than 98, Chef has fever.
                Test Case 3: Since X = 96 is not greater than 98, Chef does not have fever.
