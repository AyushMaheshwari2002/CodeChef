    It is JJ's birthday and you decide to gift him a string S (consisting of English alphabet only) of length N. But you also know that JJ does not like 
    palindromes so you decide that none of the substrings of S of length â‰¥2 should be a palindrome.

    Can you find any suitable string which can be gifted to JJ?
    Recall that a string is called palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g. noon and level are palindromic strings.

      Testcases :     3
                      2
                      2
                      4
