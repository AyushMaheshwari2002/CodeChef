    It is JJ's birthday and you decide to gift him a string S (consisting of English alphabet only) of length N. But you also know that JJ does not like 
    palindromes so you decide that none of the substrings of S of length â‰¥2 should be a palindrome.

    Can you find any suitable string which can be gifted to JJ?
    Recall that a string is called palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g. noon and level are palindromic strings.
    
                      Sample Input :
      Testcases :     3
                      2
                      2
                      4
                      Sample Output : 
                      gl
                      hf
                      waow

	Conditions which have to be avoided for a palindrome substring :-
		1. S[i] != S[i+1]         if the length of string is even
		1. S[i] != S[i+2]         if the length of string is odd
		
	If these two conditions are avoided then the resultant string is always not a palindrome.
