    An index i in a permutation P of length N is said to be good if: Pi is divisible by i
    You are given 2 integers N and K. You need to construct a permutation P of length N such that exactly K indices in that permutation are good.
    If no such permutation exists, output âˆ’1.
    If multiple such permutations exist, output any.

            Sample Input 1 
            2
            1 1
            6 2
            Sample Output 1 
            1
            4 5 6 1 2 3
            Explanation
            Test case-1: In [1], P1=1 is divisible by 1. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 1 good index.
            Test case-2: In [4,5,6,1,2,3], P1=4 is divisible by 1 and P3=6 is divisible by 3. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 2 good indices.
